Optimal DNA Sequence Alignment in Order n^2 instead of Order n^3 (1981)

In 1981 I was working with [John Devereux](https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/AQJKMSRSDFDTNP8Q) and [Oliver Smithies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Smithies) at the [University of Wisconsin](https://www.wisc.edu/). We were
developing software to analyse DNA sequence data. I realized the opitmal alignment of two DNA sequences
could be found in order n^2 time, instead of order n^3 time.

I think others arrived at the same conclusion about the same time.

This is an unpublished manuscript describing this method, along with Fortran code.
